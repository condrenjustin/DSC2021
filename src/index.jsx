          <p>We are Team Gans, a group of motivated computer science students attending Vanderbilt University.  
          We came together through our Google Developer Student Club chapter and decided to create this project.</p>
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>

          <p>Our goal is to responsibly educate and raise awareness of AI ethics. 
              Having an understanding of how data is used to make predictions allows you to really consider critically how important your data is to others, such as companies and governments, and how they might use it, and also what the limitations of systems are that are used to make consequential decisions about your lives. 
              We couldnâ€™t think of a better way to learn those skills than through art.</p>
